## Key attribute
React uses the key attributes of objects in an array to determine how to update the view generated by a component when the component is re-rendered. That is why we put `key={note.id}` so that the error in the console disappears.

## Anti-pattern: Array Indexes as Keys
We could have made the error message on our console disappear by using the array indexes as keys. The indexes can be retrieved by passing a second parameter to the callback function of the `map` method:

```js
notes.map((note, i) => ...)
```

When called like this, i is assigned the value of the index of the position in the array where the note resides.

```js
<ul>
  {notes.map((note, i) => 
    <li key={i}>
      {note.content}
    </li>
  )}
</ul>
```
This is; however, not recommended and can create undesired problems even if it seems to be working just fine.
