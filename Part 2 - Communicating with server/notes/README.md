# Rendering a collection, modules
## Key attribute
React uses the key attributes of objects in an array to determine how to update the view generated by a component when the component is re-rendered. That is why we put `key={note.id}` so that the error in the console disappears.

## Anti-pattern: Array Indexes as Keys
We could have made the error message on our console disappear by using the array indexes as keys. The indexes can be retrieved by passing a second parameter to the callback function of the `map` method:

```js
notes.map((note, i) => ...)
```

When called like this, i is assigned the value of the index of the position in the array where the note resides.

```js
<ul>
  {notes.map((note, i) => 
    <li key={i}>
      {note.content}
    </li>
  )}
</ul>
```
This is; however, not recommended and can create undesired problems even if it seems to be working just fine.

# Forms

```js
const App = (props) => {
const [notes, setNotes] = useState(props.notes)
```
The component uses the `useState` function to initialize the piece of state stored in `notes` with the array of notes passed in the props:

We have added the `addNote` function as an event handler to the form element that will be called when the form is submitted, by clicking the submit button.

The `event` parameter is the event that triggers the call to the event handler function:

The event handler immediately calls the `event.preventDefault()` method, which prevents the default action of submitting a form. The default action would, among other things, cause the page to reload.
```js
const addNote = (event) => {
  event.preventDefault()
  onsole.log('button clicked', event.target)
}
```
In order to enable editing of the input element, we have to register an event handler that synchronizes the changes made to the input with the component's state:

```js
  const handleNoteChange = (event) => {
  console.log(event.target.value)
  setNewNote(event.target.value)
 }
```
We have now registered an event handler to the onChange attribute of the form's input element:

```js
<input
  value={newNote}
  onChange={handleNoteChange}
/>
```

The `target` property of the event object now corresponds to the controlled input element and `event.target.value` refers to the input value of that element.


# Getting data from server
7
Install JSON server globally: `npm install -g json-server`

A global installation is not necessary. From the root directory of the app, we can run the json-server using the command npx: `npx json-server --port 3001 --watch db.json`

Going forward, the idea will be to save the notes to the server, which in this case means saving to the json-server. The React code fetches the notes from the server and renders them to the screen. Whenever a new note is added to the application the React code also sends it to the server to make the new note persist in "memory".

## npm

We will use the promise based function [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch) to pull the data from the server. Fetch is a great tool. It is standardized and supported by all modern browsers.

We will be using the `axios` library instead for communication between the browser and server. It functions like fetch, but is somewhat more pleasant to use. Another good reason to use axios is our getting familiar with adding external libraries, so-called npm packages, to React projects.

**npm-commands should always be run in the project root directory**, which is where the package.json file can be found.

 Install json-server as a development dependency (only used during development) by executing the command:
 `npm install json-server --save-dev`

Make a small addition to the scripts part of the package.json file:

We can now conveniently, without parameter definitions, start the json-server from the project root directory with the command:

`npm run server`

The command npm install was used twice, but with slight differences:

```
npm install axios
npm install json-server --save-dev
```
There is a fine difference in the parameters. axios is installed as a runtime dependency of the application, because the execution of the program requires the existence of the library. On the other hand, json-server was installed as a development dependency (--save-dev), since the program itself doesn't require it.
